# Rook-Ceph
- Distributed Storage Systems - these are infra that can split data across multiple physical servers, and often across more than one data center
- It typically takes the form of a cluster of storage units, with a mechanism for cluster sync and and coordination between cluster nodes
- Ceph is a distributed storage system. Rook simplifies the deployment of Ceph on a k8s cluster
- Ceph is also a DSS that is scalable and high-performing with no single point of failure
- Ceph is also a Software Distributed System which means it can be run across any hardware that matches its requirements
